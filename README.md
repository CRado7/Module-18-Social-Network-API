# Social Network API

This project is a RESTful API for a social network application that allows users to interact with each other by creating and sharing thoughts, reacting to thoughts, and managing their friend lists.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up your MongoDB database and ensure it is running.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string as `MONGODB_URI`.
5. Run the server using `npm start`.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can use a tool like Insomnia to interact with the API:

- Use GET routes to retrieve data for users and thoughts in formatted JSON.
- Use POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to create, update, and delete users and thoughts.
- Use POST and DELETE routes to create and delete reactions to thoughts.
- Use POST and DELETE routes to add and remove friends from a user's friend list.
